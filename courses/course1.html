                <h2>C. Is retirement necessary?</h2>
                <p>Nowadays, this is an issue, discussed a lot. The problem is that many people think that non-young programmers are not as good as the young ones. Well, us, Code-Monkeys and Code-Gorillas, can prove these people wrong! We are qualified, smart and intelligent enough to be better than the young programmers! So, our answer to this question is: No, it is not, as long as you are a part of our community - and as long as you are a real Code-Monkey or Code-Gorilla!</p>
