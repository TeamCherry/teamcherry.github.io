            <h1>Welcome to Code-Monkey!</h1>
            <p>One of Code-Monkey's goals is to offer current or future students information about life at <a href="https://softuni.bg/" target="_blank">SoftUni</a> and to share fun and interesting stuff about programming. It is a place for everyone who wants to start out as a software engineer and wants to hear the other side of the story - the students' point of view. The site contains programmer humour and is not expected to be understood by someone who is not a "code-monkey". </p>

            <p>Love is the main link between SoftUni and Code-Monkey. Lack of love will guide you to your spiritual and software-developmental downfall. We hope that these words will move you. If you have no love at least accept ours through this song:</p>

            <p>Remember: Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.</p>
